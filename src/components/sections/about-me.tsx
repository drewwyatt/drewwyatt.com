        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I build software that gets people excited. At home and at work I like to create things that make life easier and more fun.</p>
        <p>I have experience with a variety of languages, frameworks, and mediums. I have built web APIs that serve data to thousands of users, a phone system that handles calls for a multi-million dollar company, and online reservation software for a state university. I work well with teams and am no stranger to agile development processes. I solve problems.</p>
