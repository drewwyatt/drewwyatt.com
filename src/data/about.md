I work as a Lead Engineer for [Bottle Rocket Studios](https://www.bottlerocketstudios.com/). Officially I am on the front-end web team, but that has also given me the opportunity to build things with React Native, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Apple TV.


I've recently come to appreciate the magic of functional programming - mostly because of [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux). I've also been spending a lot of time with:

* TypeScript
* React (and React Native)
* Jest
* Webpack
* RXJS
* Docker
* AWS (S3, Lambda, EC2)


I enjoy learning and teaching, and am thankful to be able to work with so many talanted people inside and outside of my 9-5.
